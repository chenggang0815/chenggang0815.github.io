        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>

        <p>I am Yanjie He, a Data Scientist who is interested in computer science, statistics, and economics. Currently, I am studying at the Data Analytics program at the George Washington University.</p>

        <p>I have experience in both academic and industry. My first internship is in Kantar Media CIC, which is a company focusing on social media data analysis. That experience was super fun. I developed a text mining system with team members and designed a sentimental analysis solution. Also, I provided a data visualization solution, which is to plot a Venn graph automatically based on given data.</p>

        <p>After I came to the United States, I got an on-campus job in the George Washington University. I am working as a computational social scientist, and what I do in every week is to help Professor Pamphile with her research work. It is an excellent opportunity for me to apply my analytical skills to solve academic problems.</p>

        <p>I am a team member in Professor Benjamin Harvey's A.I. project. I am developing a recommender system with the joint effort of team members. From this experience, I learned the process of system development. There are still a lot learn, and it will be inspiring to me.</p>
